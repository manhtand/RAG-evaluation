Business.Our MissionImprove people’s lives with the world’s best transportation.OverviewLyft,  Inc  (the  “Company”  or  “Lyft”)  started  a  movement  to  revolutionize  transportation.  In  2012,  we  launched  our  peer-to-peer  marketplace  for  on-demandridesharing and have continued to pioneer innovations aligned with our mission. Today, Lyft is one of the largest multimodal transportation networks in the United Statesand Canada.We believe that the world is at the beginning of a shift away from car ownership to Transportation-as-a-Service (“TaaS”). Lyft is at the forefront of this massivesocietal change. Our ridesharing marketplace connects drivers with riders via the Lyft mobile application (the “Lyft App”) in cities across the United States and in selectcities in Canada. We believe that our ridesharing marketplace allows riders to use their cars less and offers a viable alternative to car ownership while providing driversusing our platform the freedom and independence to choose when, where, how long and on what platforms they work. As this evolution continues, we believe there is amassive opportunity for us to improve the lives of riders by connecting them to more affordable and convenient transportation options.We are laser-focused on revolutionizing transportation. We have established a scaled network of users brought together by our robust technology platform (the“Lyft  Platform”)  that  powers  rides  and  connections  every  day.  We  leverage  our  technology  platform,  the  scale  and  density  of  our  user  network  and  insights  from  asignificant number of rides to continuously improve our ridesharing marketplace efficiency and develop new offerings. We’ve also taken steps to ensure our network iswell positioned to benefit from technological innovation in mobility.Today, our offerings include an expanded set of transportation modes in select cities, such as access to a network of shared bikes and scooters (“Light Vehicles”)for shorter rides and first-mile and last-mile legs of multimodal trips, information about nearby public transit routes, and Lyft Rentals, an offering for renters who want torent a car for a fixed period of time for personal use.",

Our vision is to rebuildcities around people by offering seamless access through the Lyft App to on-demand rides, public transit, and car rentals as well as lower-carbon micromobility modes. Asanother step in the shift from personal car ownership, we’ve also launched Lyft Pink, our premier membership program, which offers discounted pricing for rideshare,bikes, and scooters, in addition to perks for car rentals.We launched our national Resilient Streets Initiative in September 2020 and offered a vision for how cities can safely and efficiently move the greatest number ofpeople as economic, educational and social activities resume in our cities. The initiative reimagined what a “resilient street corridor” might look like in cities where Lyftoperates  micromobility  services.  It  also  investigated  the  impact  of  street  design  on  key  metrics  around  vehicle  miles  traveled,  socioeconomic  demographics  and  GHGemissions.12",
            "Because we stand at a pivotal moment in the fight against climate change, Lyft made the commitment to reach 10\n0% EVs on the Lyft Platform by the end of 2030.By working with drivers to transition to EVs, we have the potential to avoid tens of millions of metric tons of GHG emissions to the atmosphere and to reduce gasolineconsumption  by  more  than  a  billion  gallons  over  the  next  decade.  This  is  in  line  with  the  Clean  Miles  Standard  and  Incentive  Program  which  was  approved  by  theCalifornia Air Resources Board in May 2021 and sets the target that ninety percent of rideshare miles in California must be in EVs by the end of 2030. The shift to 100%EVs will mean transitioning all vehicles used on the Lyft platform over the next decade to all-electric or other zero-emission technologies. This includes cars in ExpressDrive, Lyft Rentals, Lyft Autonomous, and personal cars used by drivers on the Lyft platform. Switching to EVs is not just good for the planet; it’s good for people – riders,drivers, and the communities they serve.SocialWe approach working with our partners, cities and municipalities in a collaborative manner and seek to establish mutually beneficial relationships based on trust,respect and a common objective of improving people’s lives by improving transportation. Through our LyftUp initiative, we’re working to enable access to affordable,reliable transportation for all — no matter income or zip code. We built LyftUp to account for those still left behind. LyftUp aims to bridge some of the most seriousoutstanding transportation gaps.

Further, COVID-19 has and may continue to negatively impact Lyft’s ability to conduct rental operationsthrough the Express Drive program and Lyft Rentals as a result of restrictions on travel, mandated closures, limited staffing availability, and other factors relatedto COVID-19. For example, in 2020, Lyft Rentals temporarily ceased operations, closing its rental locations, as a result of COVID-19. Further, while ExpressDrive rental periods renew on a weekly basis, new rental reservations were temporarily blocked in 2020, and subsequently re-opened with modified operations tolimit the proximity and amount of interactions between associates and drivers, and to address additional cleaning which may be required as a result of COVID-19.These operations are more costly, and vulnerable to shortages of cleaning supplies or other materials required to operate rental sites while minimizing the risk ofexposure to COVID-19. As a result of the adverse impact to demand for rides on the rideshare platform, drivers renting through the Express Drive program havehad and may continue to have a diminished ability to pay their rental fees. In response, in 2020, Flexdrive temporarily reduced pricing for Flexdrive rentals incities most affected by COVID-19, which has since been reversed. In 2020, Flexdrive also began to waive rental fees for drivers who are confirmed to have testedpositive for COVID-19 or requested to quarantine by a medical professional, which it continues to do at this time. Further, Lyft Rentals and Flexdrive have facedsignificantly higher costs in transporting, repossessing, cleaning, and17"

            "Incentives  provided  todrivers, Light Vehicle riders and Lyft Rental renters, the customers of the Company, are accounted for as a reduction of the transaction price. As the riders are not theCompany’s customers, incentives provided to riders are generally recognized as sales and marketing expense except for certain pricing programs described below.Driver IncentivesThe  Company  offers  various  incentive  programs  to  drivers,  including  minimum  guaranteed  payments,  volume-based  discounts  and  performance-based  bonuspayments.  These  driver  incentives  are  similar  to  retrospective  volume-based  rebates  and  represent  variable  consideration  that  is  typically  settled  within  a  week.  TheCompany reduces the transaction price by the estimated amount of the incentives expected to be paid upon completion of the performance criteria by applying the mostlikely outcome method. Therefore, such driver incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenue. Driver incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenue if the Companydoes not receive a distinct good or service in exchange for the payment or cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the good or service received. Driver incentives forreferring new drivers or riders are accounted for as sales and marketing expense. The amount recorded as an expense is the lesser of the amount of the payment or theestablished fair value of the benefit received. The fair value of the benefit is established using amounts paid to third parties for similar services.Rideshare Rider IncentivesThe Company has several rideshare rider incentive programs, which are offered to encourage rider activity on the Lyft Platform. Generally, the rider incentiveprograms are as follows:(i)Market-wide marketing promotions. Market-wide  promotions reduce the fare charged by drivers to riders for all or substantially all rides in a specific market.This type of incentive effectively reduces the overall pricing of the service provided by drivers for that specific market and the gross fare charged by thedriver to the rider, and thereby results in a lower fee earned by the Company. Accordingly, the Company records this type of incentive as a reduction torevenue at the date it records the corresponding revenue transaction.(ii)Targeted marketing promotions. Targeted  marketing promotions are used to promote the use of the Lyft Platform to a targeted group of riders.",

Asanother step in the shift from personal car ownership, we’ve also launched Lyft Pink, our premier membership program, which offers discounted pricing for rideshare,bikes, and scooters, in addition to perks for car rentals.We launched our national Resilient Streets Initiative in September 2020 and offered a vision for how cities can safely and efficiently move the greatest number ofpeople as economic, educational and social activities resume in our cities. The initiative reimagined what a “resilient street corridor” might look like in cities where Lyftoperates  micromobility  services.

            "Because we stand at a pivotal moment in the fight against climate change, Lyft made the commitment to reach 10\n0% EVs on the Lyft Platform by the end of 2030.By working with drivers to transition to EVs, we have the potential to avoid tens of millions of metric tons of GHG emissions to the atmosphere and to reduce gasolineconsumption  by  more  than  a  billion  gallons  over  the  next  decade.  This  is  in  line  with  the  Clean  Miles  Standard  and  Incentive  Program  which  was  approved  by  theCalifornia Air Resources Board in May 2021 and sets the target that ninety percent of rideshare miles in California must be in EVs by the end of 2030. The shift to 100%EVs will mean transitioning all vehicles used on the Lyft platform over the next decade to all-electric or other zero-emission technologies. This includes cars in ExpressDrive, Lyft Rentals, Lyft Autonomous, and personal cars used by drivers on the Lyft platform. Switching to EVs is not just good for the planet; it’s good for people – riders,drivers, and the communities they serve.SocialWe approach working with our partners, cities and municipalities in a collaborative manner and seek to establish mutually beneficial relationships based on trust,respect and a common objective of improving people’s lives by improving transportation. Through our LyftUp initiative, we’re working to enable access to affordable,reliable transportation for all — no matter income or zip code. We built LyftUp to account for those still left behind. LyftUp aims to bridge some of the most seriousoutstanding transportation gaps.

Today, Lyft is one of the largest multimodal transportation networks in the United Statesand Canada.We believe that the world is at the beginning of a shift away from car ownership to Transportation-as-a-Service (“TaaS”). Lyft is at the forefront of this massivesocietal change. Our ridesharing marketplace connects drivers with riders via the Lyft mobile application (the “Lyft App”) in cities across the United States and in selectcities in Canada. We believe that our ridesharing marketplace allows riders to use their cars less and offers a viable alternative to car ownership while providing driversusing our platform the freedom and independence to choose when, where, how long and on what platforms they work. As this evolution continues, we believe there is amassive opportunity for us to improve the lives of riders by connecting them to more affordable and convenient transportation options.We are laser-focused on revolutionizing transportation. We have established a scaled network of users brought together by our robust technology platform (the“Lyft  Platform”)  that  powers  rides  and  connections  every  day.  We  leverage  our  technology  platform,  the  scale  and  density  of  our  user  network  and  insights  from  asignificant number of rides to continuously improve our ridesharing marketplace efficiency and develop new offerings. We’ve also taken steps to ensure our network iswell positioned to benefit from technological innovation in mobility.Today, our offerings include an expanded set of transportation modes in select cities, such as access to a network of shared bikes and scooters (“Light Vehicles”)for shorter rides and first-mile and last-mile legs of multimodal trips, information about nearby public transit routes, and Lyft Rentals, an offering for renters who want torent a car for a fixed period of time for personal use."

            "Incentives  provided  todrivers, Light Vehicle riders and Lyft Rental renters, the customers of the Company, are accounted for as a reduction of the transaction price. As the riders are not theCompany’s customers, incentives provided to riders are generally recognized as sales and marketing expense except for certain pricing programs described below.Driver IncentivesThe  Company  offers  various  incentive  programs  to  drivers,  including  minimum  guaranteed  payments,  volume-based  discounts  and  performance-based  bonuspayments.  These  driver  incentives  are  similar  to  retrospective  volume-based  rebates  and  represent  variable  consideration  that  is  typically  settled  within  a  week.  TheCompany reduces the transaction price by the estimated amount of the incentives expected to be paid upon completion of the performance criteria by applying the mostlikely outcome method. Therefore, such driver incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenue. Driver incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenue if the Companydoes not receive a distinct good or service in exchange for the payment or cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the good or service received. Driver incentives forreferring new drivers or riders are accounted for as sales and marketing expense. The amount recorded as an expense is the lesser of the amount of the payment or theestablished fair value of the benefit received. The fair value of the benefit is established using amounts paid to third parties for similar services.Rideshare Rider IncentivesThe Company has several rideshare rider incentive programs, which are offered to encourage rider activity on the Lyft Platform. Generally, the rider incentiveprograms are as follows:(i)Market-wide marketing promotions. Market-wide  promotions reduce the fare charged by drivers to riders for all or substantially all rides in a specific market.This type of incentive effectively reduces the overall pricing of the service provided by drivers for that specific market and the gross fare charged by thedriver to the rider, and thereby results in a lower fee earned by the Company. Accordingly, the Company records this type of incentive as a reduction torevenue at the date it records the corresponding revenue transaction.(ii)Targeted marketing promotions. Targeted  marketing promotions are used to promote the use of the Lyft Platform to a targeted group of riders."

For  example,  to  continually  launch  new  innovations  on  our  platform,  we  haveinvested heavily in research and development and have completed multiple strategic acquisitions. We have also invested in sales and marketing to grow our community,cultivate a differentiated brand that resonates with drivers and riders and promote further brand awareness. Together, these investments have enabled us to create a powerfulmultimodal platform and scaled user network.Notwithstanding the impact of COVID-19, we are continuing to invest in the future, both organically and through acquisitions of complementary businesses. Wealso continue to invest in the expansion of our network of Light Vehicles and Lyft Autonomous, which focuses on the deployment and scaling of third-party self-drivingtechnology on the Lyft network. Our strategy is to always be at the forefront of transportation innovation, and we believe that through these investments, we will continueto be well positioned as a leader in TaaS.",

Business.Our MissionImprove people’s lives with the world’s best transportation.OverviewLyft,  Inc  (the  “Company”  or  “Lyft”)  started  a  movement  to  revolutionize  transportation.  In  2012,  we  launched  our  peer-to-peer  marketplace  for  on-demandridesharing and have continued to pioneer innovations aligned with our mission. Today, Lyft is one of the largest multimodal transportation networks in the United Statesand Canada.We believe that the world is at the beginning of a shift away from car ownership to Transportation-as-a-Service (“TaaS”). Lyft is at the forefront of this massivesocietal change. Our ridesharing marketplace connects drivers with riders via the Lyft mobile application (the “Lyft App”) in cities across the United States and in selectcities in Canada. We believe that our ridesharing marketplace allows riders to use their cars less and offers a viable alternative to car ownership while providing driversusing our platform the freedom and independence to choose when, where, how long and on what platforms they work. As this evolution continues, we believe there is amassive opportunity for us to improve the lives of riders by connecting them to more affordable and convenient transportation options.We are laser-focused on revolutionizing transportation. We have established a scaled network of users brought together by our robust technology platform (the“Lyft  Platform”)  that  powers  rides  and  connections  every  day.  We  leverage  our  technology  platform,  the  scale  and  density  of  our  user  network  and  insights  from  asignificant number of rides to continuously improve our ridesharing marketplace efficiency and develop new offerings. We’ve also taken steps to ensure our network iswell positioned to benefit from technological innovation in mobility.Today, our offerings include an expanded set of transportation modes in select cities, such as access to a network of shared bikes and scooters (“Light Vehicles”)for shorter rides and first-mile and last-mile legs of multimodal trips, information about nearby public transit routes, and Lyft Rentals, an offering for renters who want torent a car for a fixed period of time for personal use.",

In 2021, we saw continuedrecovery as vaccines were more widely distributed and more communities fully reopened, which resulted in revenue increasing 36% in 2021 compared to the prior year,and the number of Active Riders increasing 49.2% in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. Net loss decreased $743.5 million, or 42%, from$1.8 billion in 2020 to $1.0 billion in 2021, which included a benefit from a pre-tax gain of $119.3 million from the transaction with Woven Planet. Adjusted EBITDA in2021  was  $92.9  million,  marking  our  first  annual  Adjusted  EBITDA  profitability.  We  remain  focused  on  our  long-term  growth  opportunities.

Business.Our MissionImprove people’s lives with the world’s best transportation.OverviewLyft,  Inc  (the  “Company”  or  “Lyft”)  started  a  movement  to  revolutionize  transportation.  In  2012,  we  launched  our  peer-to-peer  marketplace  for  on-demandridesharing and have continued to pioneer innovations aligned with our mission. Today, Lyft is one of the largest multimodal transportation networks in the United Statesand Canada.We believe that the world is at the beginning of a shift away from car ownership to Transportation-as-a-Service (“TaaS”). Lyft is at the forefront of this massivesocietal change. Our ridesharing marketplace connects drivers with riders via the Lyft mobile application (the “Lyft App”) in cities across the United States and in selectcities in Canada. We believe that our ridesharing marketplace allows riders to use their cars less and offers a viable alternative to car ownership while providing driversusing our platform the freedom and independence to choose when, where, how long and on what platforms they work. As this evolution continues, we believe there is amassive opportunity for us to improve the lives of riders by connecting them to more affordable and convenient transportation options.We are laser-focused on revolutionizing transportation. We have established a scaled network of users brought together by our robust technology platform (the“Lyft  Platform”)  that  powers  rides  and  connections  every  day.  We  leverage  our  technology  platform,  the  scale  and  density  of  our  user  network  and  insights  from  asignificant number of rides to continuously improve our ridesharing marketplace efficiency and develop new offerings. We’ve also taken steps to ensure our network iswell positioned to benefit from technological innovation in mobility.Today, our offerings include an expanded set of transportation modes in select cities, such as access to a network of shared bikes and scooters (“Light Vehicles”)for shorter rides and first-mile and last-mile legs of multimodal trips, information about nearby public transit routes, and Lyft Rentals, an offering for renters who want torent a car for a fixed period of time for personal use.",

We are unable to predict when and to what extent these public health and safety measures may be eased, how riders will respond to the easing of suchmeasures, as well as whether additional measures may need to be implemented in the future, any of which may continue to result in decreased demand notwithstandingusual seasonality.Our Brand and MarketingWe believe good energy moves the world. The Lyft brand is rooted in our hospitality principles: safety, simplicity, reliability, care, and delight. Our marketingefforts bring our brand to life across a variety of communication channels ranging from national broadcast campaigns to more direct communications like email and socialmedia engagement. We also benefit from positive word of mouth in the existing Lyft rider communityOur marketing efforts educate people about Lyft products in creative and memorable ways and generate greater brand awareness among potential drivers andriders. Our brand marketing includes but is not limited to Lyft-produced content, culture and entertainment partnerships, marketing partnerships, sponsored local events,and outdoor advertisements.We use specific channels and initiatives so we can measure the impact of our marketing spend. We attract new drivers and riders through referrals, partnerships,display advertising, radio, video, social media, email, search engine optimization, keyword search campaigns, and more."

An Active Rider is identified bya unique phone number. If a rider has two mobile phone numbers or changed their phone number and such rider took rides using both phone numbers during the quarter,that person would count as two Active Riders. If a rider has a personal and business profile tied to the same mobile phone number, that person would be considered a singleActive Rider. If a ride has been requested by an organization using our Concierge offering for the benefit of a rider, we exclude this rider in the calculation of Active Ridersunless the ride is accessible in the Lyft App. Revenue per Active Rider is calculated by dividing revenue for a period by Active Riders for the same period.Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, some riders were able to access their Concierge rides in the Lyft App if they already had a Lyft account. Accordingly,Lyft updated the definition of Active Riders to include Concierge riders if the rider’s phone number matches that of a verified Lyft account, allowing the rider to accesstheir ride in the Lyft App. This update resulted in a 0.01% increase, or an additional 927 Active Riders in the fourth quarter of 2020."

We are  also  expanding the  supportavailable to drivers at our Driver Hubs, our driver-centric service centers and community spaces, Driver Centers, our vehicle service centers, Mobile Services, Lyft AutoCare,  and  through  our Express  Drive  vehicle  rental  program.  In addition,  we have  established  environmental  programs,  such  as our commitment  to 100% EVs  on ourplatform by the end of 2030. These offerings and programs require significant capital investments and recurring costs, including debt payments, maintenance, depreciation,asset life and asset replacement costs, and if we are not able to maintain sufficient levels of utilization of such assets or such offerings are otherwise not successful, ourinvestments may not generate sufficient returns and our financial condition may be adversely affected."

Today, Lyft is one of the largest multimodal transportation networks in the United Statesand Canada.We believe that the world is at the beginning of a shift away from car ownership to Transportation-as-a-Service (“TaaS”). Lyft is at the forefront of this massivesocietal change. Our ridesharing marketplace connects drivers with riders via the Lyft mobile application (the “Lyft App”) in cities across the United States and in selectcities in Canada. We believe that our ridesharing marketplace allows riders to use their cars less and offers a viable alternative to car ownership while providing driversusing our platform the freedom and independence to choose when, where, how long and on what platforms they work. As this evolution continues, we believe there is amassive opportunity for us to improve the lives of riders by connecting them to more affordable and convenient transportation options.We are laser-focused on revolutionizing transportation. We have established a scaled network of users brought together by our robust technology platform (the“Lyft  Platform”)  that  powers  rides  and  connections  every  day.  We  leverage  our  technology  platform,  the  scale  and  density  of  our  user  network  and  insights  from  asignificant number of rides to continuously improve our ridesharing marketplace efficiency and develop new offerings. We’ve also taken steps to ensure our network iswell positioned to benefit from technological innovation in mobility.Today, our offerings include an expanded set of transportation modes in select cities, such as access to a network of shared bikes and scooters (“Light Vehicles”)for shorter rides and first-mile and last-mile legs of multimodal trips, information about nearby public transit routes, and Lyft Rentals, an offering for renters who want torent a car for a fixed period of time for personal use.",
            "We also provide centralized tools and enterprise transportation solutions, such as our Concierge offering, that enable organizationsto manage the transportation needs of customers, employees and other constituents.•Grow Active Riders. We  see opportunities to continue to recoup and grow our rider base amid the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. We may make incrementalinvestments in our brand and in growth marketing to maintain and drive increasing consumer preference for Lyft. We may also offer discounts for first-time ridersto try Lyft or provide incentives to existing riders to encourage increased ride frequency. We plan to continue to add density to our ridesharing marketplace byattracting and retaining more drivers on our network to deliver the best possible service levels. Additionally, we will continue to evaluate ways to expand ournetwork  coverage  beyond  the  geographies  and  markets  we  currently  serve.  We  also  believe  we  are  a  beneficiary  of  demographic  shifts,  such  as  the  growingpercentage of the U.S. population that is accustomed to on-demand services and has digital-first preferences.•Grow Our Share of Consumers’ Transportation Spend. Lyft’s  transportation network is designed to address a wide range of mobility needs. The Lyft networkspans rideshare, car rentals, bikes, scooters, transit and vehicle services. By integrating the fragmented transportation ecosystem, we are well positioned to deliverthe best holistic experience to all of our riders and to capture significantly more of our market opportunity.•Deliver  Increasing  Value  to  Drivers. We  strive  to  provide  drivers  that  use  Lyft  with  the  best  possible  experience,  including  access  to  the  best  economicopportunities. For example, through our Express Drive program, drivers can get access to rental cars they can use for ridesharing. We’ve also been investing in ourDriver  Centers,  Mobile  Services  and  related  partnerships  that  offer  drivers  affordable  and  convenient  vehicle  maintenance  services.  By  making  the  driverexperience better and better, we can retain and attract more drivers to Lyft’s network.•Invest in our Marketplace Technology."

Our investment also allows us to makesteps toward our commitment to reach 100% EVs on the Lyft Platform by the end of 2030. From time to time, we may seek additional equity or debt financing to fundcapital expenditures, strategic initiatives or investments and our ongoing operations, or to refinance our existing or future indebtedness.
